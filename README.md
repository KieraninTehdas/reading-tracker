# Reading Tracker App Backend

This is the backend for a very simple app to track reading lists of what books you're reading, what
you've read, and what you want to read.

I was intending this to be a quick thing as I was most interested in improving my frontend skills,
but I've got a bit carried away. Eventually I'll get round to building the UI as I had intended!

I've ended up using this as an opportunity to try out a few different ways of doing things with
Spring Boot that I've never had time to try. This project isn't intended for real production use,
hence the number of questionable things!
